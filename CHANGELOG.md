# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 0.3.0 - 2017-11-28

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization/pull/13) adds
  a requirement on the mezzio-authentication package, v 0.2.0 and up.

### Changed

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization/pull/13)
  modifies the `AuthorizationMiddleware` workflow. It now looks for a
  `Mezzio\Authentication\UserInterface` request parameter that
  implements that interface; with none available, it returns a 401 status.
  Additionally, it now uses `UserInterface::getUserRoles()`, which returns an
  array of roles; as such, it loops through each, delegating request processing
  for the first role granted permission.

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization/pull/13)
  pins to http-interop/http-middleware 0.4.1, as that is the most recent version
  supported by mezzio-authentication.

### Deprecated

## 0.2.0 - 2017-10-09

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization#8](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization/pull/8) adds
  support for http-interop/http-middleware 0.5.0 via a polyfill provided by the
  package webimpress/http-middleware-compatibility. Essentially, this means you
  can drop this package into an application targeting either the 0.4.1 or 0.5.0
  versions of http-middleware, and it will "just work".
